Java perspective:

---If in eclipse we use Java perspective then all the jars downloaded through pom.xml will 
    be present under Referenced Libraries .

JavaEE perspective:

--If in eclipse we are in Java EE perspective then all the jars downloaded through pom.xml will 
    be present directly under JREsystem library.  
 
In this project learntestng we deal with integrating testng and maven.

1.  Run the java file from command prompt --> from maven
2.  Run the testng.xml( testng project) from maven command line
   (using ant also we can run from cmd line but maven has better features 
      regarding jars.)
3.  Generating surefire reports with maven
4.  Generating XSLT reports with maven
 
 
1. If we wan to run the java file at command prompt through maven then we use maven sure fire plugin. 
   To trigger tesng.xml fie from pom.xml we use mven surefire plugin. 
  
  
 --  mvn test  ---> this command will execute the tests as per the tests in testng.xml
 --  mvn test site --> this command will execute the tests(project) and also generate 
                      some apache reports
    
 --  mvn surefire-report:report---> this command at prompt will execute tests and 
                                     also generate surefire reports
                                 
--> Surefire reports are generated after refreshing project and under 
     the target folder (inside site folder) in project location.
